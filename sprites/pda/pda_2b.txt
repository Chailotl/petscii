| | For a follow-up experiment, we need    | |
| | you to carefully reorient the egg      | |
| | perpendicular to its current rotation. | |
| | Using this PDA's integrated cameras we | |
| | will calculate its center of mass and  | |
| | estimate its weight distribution using | |
| | our advanced proprietary imaging AI.   | |
| |                                        | |
| | In layman's terms: please push the egg | |
| | to its side.                           | |
